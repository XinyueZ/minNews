What?
The Google Reader is dead, and we need some Apps that provide small feeds.
This is just a simple news App on Android. But it is small and use Volley of Google. It might be an other alternative for us. Support English, Chinese, German. And it uses faroo.com as  back-end. There is a middle-ware between faroo and the client as well.

Working.
I've moved that App to Android Studio to keep pace of Google.

Last update.
Added Tab to control "home", "searched" pages. It's been improved.

Bug
There's a lot. 
  *  There's moment no bind between searched items and "home" items. The bookmark can not effect each other.
